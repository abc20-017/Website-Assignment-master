      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Language And Culture</h1>
      <p>The first thing to bear in mind when moving to Barcelona, is that whilst outsiders tend to consider Barcelona part of Spain, the native Catalans consider Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, an autonomous region with dreams of complete independence. In fact, if you’ve been watching the news for over the last few years you can hardly have missed their point! Even as it stands, with Catalonia as part of Spain, Catalan is the first official language of the the city and region, with road signs, metro instructions and other public notices often appearing in Catalan and not Spanish, whilst Catalan is spoken in all public institutions – such as schools.</p>
      <p>if you’re planning on spending any time in Barcelona, then you should definitely do your best to pick up at least basic Spanish, and there’s certainly no shortage of language schools in Barcelona willing to help you. For day-to-day purposes, you might be able to get by in English but for emergencies and for dealing with household situations, Spanish is essential – finding an English-speaking locksmith for example isn’t easy!</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Food And Drinks </h1>
      <p>Paella and sangria are typical holiday-maker fare, but in Catalonia a bit more rare (or at least not consumed by locals). Traditional Catalan food tends to be earthy rustic fare, but thanks to a culinary revolution in recent years, modern Catalan cuisine is considered some of the best in the world, with chefs like <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/biography-of-chef-ferran-adria-1664996#:~:text=%20The%20Biography%20of%20Chef%20Ferran%20Adria%20,a%20number%20of%20restaurants%20before%20finally...%20More%20">Ferran Adria</a> blazing a trail.Drinks-wise you’re in right in the heart of Spain/Catalonia’s Cava country. The Penedes region is where you’ll find a host of vineyards producing both fine table and sparkling wines. You’ll find a scattering of authentic Cava bars for trying it yourself, or else sign up for a wine tour.Whilst your sophisticated taste buds are sure to appreciate these sensory pleasures, there will naturally be some times when you simply want to get your hands on some of the familiar food and drink you know from back home. Major international supermarkets like <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/carrefour/4ba51137f964a52061d838e3">Carrefour</a> and Lidl should stock many of the global brands you know and love, whilst the odd jar of Jamie Oliver’s chili pasta sauce has been spotted even in the Spanish supermercados.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Bars And HangOuts</h1>
      <p>It may lack the diversity of the London scene or the cutting edge of the experimental Berlin nightlife, but considering it’s only Spain’s second biggest city Barcelona certainly packs a helluva party punch – and whether you like to get high with the hippies, or <a href="https://www.barcelona-life.com/barcelona-nightlife-tour">get down with the glitterati</a> you’ll find more than enough going on after the sun goes down… in fact, if you want to keep pace with the locals, you’d best be prepared to see the sun come back up again.A metropolitan city of close to two million people (five if you include the whole urban area), there isn’t one area to sample Barcelona’s nightlife but rather a whole host of happening neighbourhoods to check out.Knowing a few friendly bars where you kick back with a beer in good company can make any transition a lot easier, and in Barcelona there are no shortage of international bars, restaurants and hang outs.For those feeling nostalgic for home there are a glut of great British and Irish pubs that welcome the homesick with a pint of Guinness.Popular recommendations are <a href="https://pflaherty.com/barcelona/">Flaherty’s</a> and <a href="https://www.wildroverbarcelona.com/">the Wild Rover</a>, two charismatic boozers at the bottom of <a href="https://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/city_visits_of_barcelona/ramblas">Las Ramblas</a> that are also reliable bets for all your Premier League and other sporting needs.</p>

      <p>I love the laid back way of life. First, I obviously had to get used to it. But by now I can say I enjoy how the Spanish just take everything a bit easier. No matter what day or time, you’ll always find people on terraces, walking by the beach or just hanging around on the local plaza with their children.</p>
